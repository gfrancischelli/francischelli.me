export const meta = {

There are lots of things I've wanted to write about but never felt comfortable doing
it in platforms not optimized for programming content.

I've finally taken the time to design and code my own blog. You can expect posts
about web development with focus on React ecosystem, career in IT and personal
life stuff

I'll also be writing about [ServiceNow](https://servicenow.com), mainly on scripting
and how to bring the platform to the modern era of webdev.

Thanks to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) authoring
capabilities it was possible to rapidly develop a simple posting static site generator.

Deployment is done with [Zeit](https://zeit.co)'s _amazing_ [Now](https://zeit.co/now)
global serverless deployments. It's Github integration deploys evey commit to master. Neat.

Thanks to [Figma](https://figma.com) being free and easy to use, and [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/)
learning resources I was able design a not terrible website. Might write something about
the lessons learned.

## Best of both worlds

I'll try to post at least one post every 2 weeks. The next one is already on the making.

It will show you a nice approach on leveraging the whole javascript ecosystem
([npm registry](https://npmjs.org), [ES6+](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/write-less-do-more-with-javascript-es6-5fd4a8e50ee2)
features and much more!) to develop complex, modern ServiceNow client applications.

Stay tuned!
