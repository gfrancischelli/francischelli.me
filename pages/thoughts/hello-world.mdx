import Post from "../../components/Post";

export const meta = {
  title: "Hello world! ðŸŒŽ",
  summary: "Finally",
  length: 3,
  published_at: "03-15-2019",
  tags: ["personal"]
};

export default ({ children }) => <Post meta={meta}>{children}</Post>;

There are lots of things I've wanted to write about but never felt comfortable doing
it in platforms not optimized for code and development content.

I've finally taken the time to design and code my own blog. You can expect posts
about web development with focus on React ecosystem, career and personal
life stuff.

I'll also be writing about [ServiceNow](https://servicenow.com), mainly on scripting
and how to bring the platform to the modern era of the web. You can also expect to read
about the entire process of making this website.

Thanks to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) authoring
capabilities it was possible to rapidly develop a simple posting static site generator.

Deployment is done with [Zeit](https://zeit.co)'s _amazing_ [Now](https://zeit.co/now)
global serverless deployments. Their Github integration deploys every commit on master
to production and on other branches to staging environment. Neat.

Thanks to [Figma](https://figma.com) being free and easy to use, and [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/)
learning resources I was able design a not terrible website. Might explore further the lessons
learned on Design, from a developer perspective.

## What's ahead

I'm aiming to publishing something at least once a month. The next one is already on the making.

It's about how to use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in ServiceNow development, taking advantage
of whole javascript ecosystem (the [largest in the world](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/))
to develop complex, modern client side applications.

Stay tuned!
